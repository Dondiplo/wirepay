image animation for pic1 javascript

1. HTML: In the HTML code, we have a `<div>` element with an `id` of "pic" that contains an `<img>` tag. Initially, we apply a class called "hidden" to this `<div>` to make it invisible.

2. CSS: In the CSS code, we define styles for the "pic" element. We set its initial state with `opacity: 0` (which makes it completely transparent) and `transform: translateY(50rem)` (which moves it 50 units downwards). We also add a transition effect with `transition: opacity 1s ease-out, transform 1s ease-out` to make the change gradual and smooth.

3. JavaScript: In the JavaScript code, we use an event listener that triggers when the page finishes loading (`DOMContentLoaded` event). Inside this event listener, we get the reference to the "pic" element using its `id`. Then, we remove the "hidden" class from the element to make it visible.

4. Delayed Animation: To create a smooth animation effect, we add the "visible" class to the "pic" element after a short delay. This is achieved using the `setTimeout` function. The "visible" class updates the CSS properties by setting `opacity: 1` (making it fully visible) and `transform: translateY(0)` (moving it back to its original position).

By combining these HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements, we achieve the desired effect of the image starting off hidden, slowly appearing from 50 units below, and transitioning up to its original position.

I hope this explanation helps you understand the process behind the code. Let me know if you have any further questions!
